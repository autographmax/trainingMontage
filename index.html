    <h1>Dear Autograph Teammates,</h1>
    <p>I'm a big fan of yours. I not only respect your work—I truly admire it.</p>
    <p>Before my nose gets too brown, let me also say that I know your work ain't easy. And that's why I'm writing to you today.</p>
    <p>I believe there's a way to make things at least a little better. And I'd like to make a case for it before my boldness fades. So here it is:</p>
    <p>You've got enough damn Jira tickets on your plate already. Building out an entire CMS shouldn't be one of 'em.</p>
    <p>Neither should those tiny little copy changes coming in from Marketing. Or Legal. Or Creative. Or anybody. (Especially me.)</p>
    <p>So: Wanna thorw 'em all on mine instead?</p>
    <p>The line above had a typo in it. The repo will show the PR I made to fix it. And now, I'd love to make some more just like it—blocking all those little changes that would otherwise come your way. And I'd love to see you guys focus on the big stuff.</p>
    <p>(Had to change that last line, too. Copilot made it a little too sappy for my taste.)</p>
    <p>Anyhow, lemme know whatcha think. And thanks for indulging this wannabe coder with your valuable attention.</p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
    <br>
    <p>Max</p>
